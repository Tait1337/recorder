Java Recorder that combines Macro and Screen Recorder.

Perfect for:
- automate tedious routines.
- screen capture how to perform a task.

Record, save, load and play the recordings of your system mouse and keyboard actions.

Capture the system screen and sound as video or animated gif file.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install Java JDK 11 or higher.
```
https://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html
```

### Installing

Clone the Repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/tait1337/recorder.git
```

Build the Web Application with Maven.
```
./mvn install
```

Check the chapter Configuration for FFmpeg and sound device configurations.

Run the Application.
```
java -Dffmpeg.home="/path/to/ffmpeg/bin" -Dffmpeg.audio.input.device="Stereomix (Realtek High Definition Audio)" -jar ./target/recorder-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Configuration

You can do configurations with [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties) or via java command line parameter -D

Download and extract the latest FFmpeg distribution. Please use the GPL licensed version which comes with libx264 encoder.
```
https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
/path/to/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg -version
```

Get the name of your system sound device. On Windows, you need to activate [Stereo Mix](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/39532/how-to-enable-stereo-mix-in-windows-7-to-record-audio/) first.
```
ffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy
```

## Running the tests

Tests can be executed via Maven.

```
./mvn test
```

## Deployment

The most basic option to run the Application is by copying the `./target/recorder-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file to the target system with pre-installed FFmpeg and Java Runtime Environment and execute it there.

```
cp ./target/recorder-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /target/system/path/
java -Dffmpeg.home="/path/to/ffmpeg/bin" -Dffmpeg.audio.input.device="Stereomix (Realtek High Definition Audio)" -jar /target/system/path/recorder-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
